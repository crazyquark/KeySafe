A KeySecGeneratePair() secure enclave demo for iOS 9.  

This demonstrates that it is possible to sign data(a transaction for example) completely in the secure enclave without exposing the private key.  

Be warned however that this iOS API only supports ECDSA keypairs from the curve Secp256r1(P-256)

Based on an idea by Sander von Loosbroek.
